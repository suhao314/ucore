#This script is designed to run with Understand - CodeCheck

# This is the error that will be returned when a violation is found
use constant ERR1 => 'Function defined with ellipsis notation: %1.';

# This registers ERR1 with Understand

sub name { return "8-4-1 Functions shall not be defined using the ellipsis notation";}

# This is the full description of the rule being tested

# This section returns the rational and examples to be given to the user through Understand
sub detailed_description { return <<"END_DESC"
<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
Passing arguments via an ellipsis bypasses the type checking performed by the compiler.
Additionally, passing an argument with non-<i>POD</i> class type leads to <i>undefined behaviour</i>.</p>
<p>
Note that the rule specifies â€œdefinedâ€? (and not â€œdeclaredâ€?) so as to permit the use of existing
library functions.</p>

<br>
<b>Example</b>
<pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">
  
  void MyPrintf ( char_t * pFormat, ... ); // Non-compliant
</pre>
