#This script is designed to run with Understand - CodeCheck
# Written by Kyle Jackson 

# Boiler Plate code
use base ("Understand::Codecheck");

# This is the error that will be returned when a violation is found

# This registers ERR1 with Understand

# This is the short error the Understand will use
sub name { return "8-0-1 An init-declarator-list or a member-declarator-list shall consist of a single init-declarator or member-declarator respectively";}

# This is the full description of the rule being tested
sub description { return "8-0-1 (Required) An init-declarator-list or a member-declarator-list shall consist of a single init-declarator or member-declarator respectively.";}

# This section returns the rational and examples to be given to the user through Understand
sub detailed_description { return <<"END_DESC"
<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
Where multiple declarators appear in the same declaration the type of an identifier may not meet
developer expectations.</p>

<br>
<b>Example</b><pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">
  
  int32_t i1; int32_t j1; // Compliant
  int32_t i2, *j2; // Non-compliant
  int32_t *i3,
          &j3 = i2; // Non-compliant
  </pre>
