#This script is designed to run with Understand - CodeCheck
# Written by Kyle Jackson

# Boiler Plate code
use base ("Understand::Codecheck");
use strict;

# This is the error that will be returned when a violation is found
use constant ERR1 => 'Unary & has been overloaded';

# This registers ERR1 with Understand
sub register_tr_text() {
  my $check = shift;
  $check->add_tr_text(ERR1);
}

# This is the short error the Understand will use
sub name { return "5-3-3 The unary & operator shall not be overloaded";}

# This is the full description of the rule being tested
sub description { return "5-3-3 (Required) The unary & operator shall not be overloaded.";}

# This section returns the rational and examples to be given to the user through Understand
sub detailed_description { return <<"END_DESC"
<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
Taking the address of an object of incomplete type where the complete type contains a user
declared operator & leads to <i>undefined behaviour</i>.</p>
<br>
<b>Example</b><pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">

  // A.h
  class A
  {
  public:
    A * operator & ( ); // Non-compliant
  };

  // f1.cc
  class A;
  void f ( A & a )
  {
    &a; // uses built-in operator &
  }
  // f2.cc

  #include "A.h"
  void f2 ( A & a )
  {
    &a; // use user-defined operator &
  }

</pre>
