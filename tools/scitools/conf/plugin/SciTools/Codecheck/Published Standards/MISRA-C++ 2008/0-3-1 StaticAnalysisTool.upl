<p><b>Rule</b><br>
Minimization of run-time failures shall be ensured by the use of at least one of:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) static analysis tools/techniques;<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) dynamic analysis tools/techniques;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) explicit coding of checks to handle run-time faults.
<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
Run-time checking is an issue (not specific to C++) to which developers need to pay special 
attention, especially as the C++ language is weak in its provision of any run-time checking. C++ 
implementations are not required to perform many of the dynamic checks that are necessary for 
robust software. It is therefore an issue that C++ developers need to consider carefully, adding 
dynamic checks to code wherever there is the potential for run-time errors to occur.
<p>Where expressions consist only of values within a well-defined range, a run-time check may 
not be necessary, provided it can be demonstrated that for all values within the defined range 
the exception cannot occur. Such a demonstration, if used, should be documented along with 
the assumptions on which it depends. However, if adopting this approach, be very careful about 
subsequent modifications of the code that may invalidate the assumptions, or of the assumptions 
changing for any other reason.
<p>The following notes give some guidance on areas where consideration needs to be given to the 
provision of dynamic checks.
<p><b>Arithmetic Errors</b><br>
This includes errors occurring in the evaluation of expressions, such as overflow, underflow, 
division by zero or loss of significant bits through shifting.
In considering integer overflow, note that unsigned integer calculations do not strictly 
overflow (producing undefined values), but the values wrap around (producing defined, but 
possibly unexpected, values).
<p><b>Pointer Arithmetic</b><br>
Ensure that when an address is calculated dynamically the computed address is reasonable 
and points somewhere meaningful. In particular it should be ensured that if a pointer points 
within a structure or array, then when the pointer has been incremented or otherwise altered 
it still points to the same structure or array. See Rule 5015, Rule 5016, Rule 5017 
and Rule 5018 for restrictions on pointer arithmetic.
<p><b>Array Bound Errors</b><br>
Ensure that array indices are within the bounds of the array size before using them to index 
the array.
<p><b>Function Arguments</b><br>
Function arguments should be validated.
<p><b>Pointer Dereferencing</b><br>
Where a function returns a pointer and that pointer is subsequently de-referenced the 
program should first check that the pointer is not NULL. Within a function, it is relatively 
straightforward to reason about which pointers may or may not hold NULL values. Across 
function boundaries, especially when calling functions defined in other source files or 
libraries, it is much more difficult.
<pre>// Given a pointer to a message, check the message header and return 
// a pointer to the body of the message or NULL if the message is 
// invalid. 
const char_t *msg_body ( const char_t * msg ) 
{ 
 const char_t * body = NULL;
 if ( msg != NULL ) 
 { 
   if ( msg_header_valid ( msg ) ) 
   { 
     body = &msg [ MSG_HEADER_SIZE ]; 
   } 
 } 
 return ( body ); 
}
... 
char_t msg_buffer [ MAX_MSG_SIZE ]; 
const char_t * payload; 
... 
payload = msg_body ( msg_buffer ); 
if ( payload != NULL ) 
{ 
 // process the message payload 
}</pre>
<p>The techniques that will be employed to minimize run-time failures should be planned and 
documented, e.g. in design standards, test plans, static analysis configuration files, code review 
checklists.
