sub detailed_description { return <<"END_DESC"

<p><b>Rationale</b><br>
If a variable does not need to be modified, then it shall be declared with <i>const</i> qualification so that
it cannot be modified. A non-parametric variable will then require its initialization at the point of
declaration. Also, future maintenance cannot accidentally modify the value.
</p>

<p><b>Example</b><br>
</p>

<pre style="margin-top:0;padding-top:0;">

  void b ( int32_t * );
  int32_t f ( int32_t * p1,         // Non-compliant
              int32_t * const p2,   // Compliant
              int32_t * const p3 )  // Compliant
  {
    *p1 = 10;
    *p2 = 10;
    b( p3 );
    int32_t i = 0;                  // Non-compliant
    return i;
  }

</pre>

ISO/IEC 14882:2003 [1] §7.1.5.1
</p>

<p><b>Developer's Note</b><br>
This check has some limitations. This check cannot detect if a set or modify reference is within a loop. Because of
this, all set and modify references will be treated as a single reference. This will cause false positives for objects
which are only modifed within a single loop.
</p>

<p>
This check also cannot detect modifications made to parameters passed by reference or pointer. This check can detect
that an object is passed by reference or is a pointer, but only counts this as a single use. This again will cause
false positives. Parameters that are passed from one function to the next will also be flagged as a violation even if
passed by reference or pointer.
</p>

<p>
Selecting the checkbox from the options will lesson the requirements of this check so that if a single set or modify 
reference is enough to justify an object not being declared as constant. This will ensure all violations are valid,
but will miss potential violations.
